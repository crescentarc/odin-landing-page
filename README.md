# odin-landing-page

For this next project, I will utlize my knowledge of HTML as well as 
my recently learned knowledge of CSS to create a landing page. This 
project topic was originally pulled from The Odin Project Foundations
Curriculum, designed to help people learn web-development. The project
page gives a final goal visually to follow and it's up to the web-dev 
trainee to use HTML and CSS to reach that finalized landing page. 
Below are the CSS concepts I hope to make use of throughout this project:

* Adjusting the color, weight, and family of a font
* Use attributes like class to help customize elements
* Showing an understanding of the cascade through efficient use of the above
* Positioning elements in an organized manner via Flexbox
