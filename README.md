# odin-landing-page

For this next project, I will utlize my knowledge of HTML as well as 
my recently learned knowledge of CSS to create a landing page. This 
project topic was originally pulled from The Odin Project Foundations
Curriculum, designed to help people learn web-development. The project
page gives a final goal visually to follow and it's up to the web-dev 
trainee to use HTML and CSS to reach that finalized landing page. 
Below are the CSS concepts I hope to make use of throughout this project:

* Adjusting the color, weight, and family of a font
* Use attributes like class to help customize elements
* Showing an understanding of the cascade through efficient use of the above
* Positioning elements in an organized manner via Flexbox

*Nov. 3 Update: By the end of this project, I feel I was able to make use of all
the skills I mentioned above. In particular, I was impressed by how much Flexbox 
streamlines the process of positioning of elements through the containers. I've
heard about the difficulty and tedium of using Float to acomplish the same task, so
I'm glad to have learned such a useful tool this early on. 

As mentioned earlier in the README, the project guidelines give a visual guide (via picture) as to how the final page should look, in terms of layout. We needed a
header, footer, multiple secitons in-between, as well as buttons and images.
The actual programming of that general layout was up to the person to figure out 
using their knowledge of HTML and CSS. In addition, what the content within those 
sections were was again up to the person programming. So I picked a made-up cooking 
forum website landing page the theme. From here on, I'll be learning about 
Javascript, so I'm looking forward to seeing how I can integrate more interactive 
elements to my future projects.
